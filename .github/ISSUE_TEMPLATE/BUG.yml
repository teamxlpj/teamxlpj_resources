        If available, add screenshots to help explain your problem, including but not limited to screenshots of MAA software, screenshots of game screens.
        If the problem is recognition related, please help by providing the original image taken by the emulator's own screenshot tool (or via adb).
        Screenshots taken with other tools may contain the frames of the window/emulator, which makes it harder for us to debug.
        The debug folder has some automatic screenshots of the error images, if you have any, please upload them together.
